# Hi there 👋
## About Me
- ⚙️ Full stack developer with experience building scalable microservices and RESTful APIs Node.js, and .NET Core. I also have professional experience building SPAs and microfrontend services with React.
- 🧠 Passionate about learning new technologies and building things — check out my latest projects here on GitHub or read more about them on my [blog](jgrove.dev).
- 🌱 When I’m not working on full-stack applications or side projects, I enjoy running, hiking & backpacking, and caring for my ever-growing collection of houseplants.
- 💬 Always happy to connect — feel free to reach out if you want to talk about backend architecture, side projects, or just swap trail recommendations!
